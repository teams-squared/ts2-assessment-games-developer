        <h3>Description</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This assessment evaluates your understanding of
            <b>Java / JVM fundamentals and systems thinking</b> through a
            combination of reasoning questions and practical coding tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will be asked to reason about memory representation, performance
            optimization, debugging strategies, data structures, and algorithm
            design.
          </li>
          <li>
            The assessment is divided into three main sections covering
            reasoning, data structures, and advanced technical tasks.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Your Role</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            As part of this assessment, you will answer reasoning questions and
            implement or describe solutions to technical problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            All tasks have been described
            <b>step-by-step</b> below. Simply follow these steps to complete the
            assessment.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may use Java, Clojure, or clear pseudocode for coding tasks.
            Bullet points are fine for reasoning questions where appropriate.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="label">Java / JVM</span> You'll work with Java or
            Clojure on the JVM, focusing on memory management, object
            allocation, and performance considerations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="label">Data Structures</span> You'll design and
            implement data structures for 3D grids, considering time complexity
            and memory optimization.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="label">Algorithms</span> You'll describe algorithms for
            ray traversal and grid operations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="label">Game Development</span> You'll demonstrate
            understanding of real-time game loops, asset pipelines, and 3D model
            integration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="label">Version Control</span> Git and GitHub are used
            to host this project's repository and for submitting your work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since this assessment will primarily use Git & GitHub, you will need
            <b>a GitHub account</b> and some experience working with the Git
            CLI.
